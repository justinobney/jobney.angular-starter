Jobney Angular Starter
====

This is just a simple base to prototype apps out. Typically I have been using
the really great plnkr.co, but I need to get back into the tooling more, so here
I stand.

Installing
----

This will install all `node_modules` and `bower_components` needed

`
npm install
`

Building
----

This will run the concatenation build script and inline all html templates
into the template cache.

`
gulp
`
